# MineSweeper Game

##### Topic Project: MineSweeper Game

Minesweeper is a popular single-player puzzle game invented in the 1970s. When the game starts, the player is given an RÃ—C rectangular grid of covered squares or cells. A fixed number of N mines are randomly placed on the grid and hidden from the player. The game begins with an empty field, and each player has their own starting position. Players open one field at a time by clicking. If there is a mine in the field, the player will explode and the game ends. Otherwise, a value between 0 and 8 will be displayed. If the value is 0, the field remains empty. This number represents the total number of mines adjacent to the uncovered field (horizontally, vertically, and diagonally). The goal of the game is to discover all areas that are free of mines.
